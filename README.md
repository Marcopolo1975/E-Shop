### Design

The site has a vibrant and clean design with the use of Orange and white color combination to give the idea of luxury and opulence. 
#### Colour Scheme
Colour palette from Coolors

![Colour Scheme](docs/readme_images/e-shop-colors.png)

The colour scheme of the site is mainly Orange and White. The colours chosen are quite neutral in order to showcase the Products with minimal distraction. 

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility.

#### Imagery
There is only one main static image on the site which is of a laptop and a shopping Cart on the home page. The color scheme of the site makes a good contrast with the main homepage image which largely consists of orange and White. The rest of the imagery will be uploaded by the site owner for individual products. 

#### Fonts
The Lato font is the main font used for the body of the website. This font was imported via Google Fonts. Sans Serif is the backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Agile Methodology
Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/)


The 5 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Database Schema 

Two relational databases were used to create this site - during production SQLite was used and then Postgres was used for the deployed Heroku version. Below is an image of how the database models relate to each other:

![Database Schema](docs/readme_images/databaseschema.png)

## Security Features and Defensive Design
### User Authentication

Where I have used Django's Class-based-views; Django's LoginRequired is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page. Django's UserPassesTest is used to limit access based on certain permissions i.e. to ensure users can only edit/delete Testimonials for which they are the author or if the user is the superuser. If the user doesn't pass the test they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

Where I have used function based views I have used Django's login_required and user_passes_test decorators to restrict access as required. 

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error.

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database. Stripe keys and wh secret are also stored in the env.py file. 

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

### Custom error pages:
Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

400 Bad Request - E Shop is unable to handle this request.
403 Page Forbidden - Looks like you're trying to access forbidden content. Please log out and sign in to the correct account.
404 Page Not Found - The page you're looking for doesn't exist.
500 Server Error - Due to an internal error we are unable to process this request.

## Business Model

E Shop's Business Model is Business to Consumer (B2C). Products and services are sold directly from E Shop to consumers who are the end-users. 
A customer of E Shop would be someone who is most likely an adult who is interested in buying luxurious interior products and high end interior design services.

## Marketing Strategy

A number of different marketing strategies have been utilised to promote E Shop including SEO, content marketing, social media marketing and email marketing. Each of these strategies have been discussed individually below:  

### SEO
Several SEO techniques were undertaken in order to ensure the site ranks highly in search engine results:

**Keywords:** 

A mixture of short tail and long tail keywords were carefully considered for the site. Keyword research was performed by checking Google search results, looking at competitor's keywords and by utilising wordtracker.com. 

An initial list of topics and keywords generated can be seen below. This list was then refined based on relevance and authority.

The most relevant keywords have been added to the site's meta-keywords and meta-description. These keywords have also been carefully included in page titles, headings, site content, `<strong></strong>` tags, image alt attributes and anchor tag links across the site. 



 ![Keywords](docs/readme_images/keywords-table.png)

**External Links:**

Included in the site footer are links to other high quality relevant websites including Houzz, Institute of Designers Ireland, and The Interiors Association. These links show search engines that the page is of good quality improving the site's ranking further. 

**Building Trust:**

In order to build brand trust, a testimonial page for interior design services has been included in the site with a link to the page being included in the page footer as well as the main nav bar. 

The page footer also includes links to the privacy policy to inform users about how their data is being collected and processed.

**Sitemap and robots.txt**

A sitemap file with a list of important page URLs was created to ensure that search engines are able to understand the site's structure and easily navigate through the site. This was made using xml-sitemaps.com.

A robots.txt file was created to tell search engines where they are not allowed to go on the website. This improves SEO by increasing the quality of the site

### Content marketing 
The site showcases high quality images of previous interior design projects projects in order to attract potential new clients. The photos allow the business to show off their expertise and style and build up trust with the customer.

### Social Media Marketing 
For this site, a Facebook business page has been created for organic social media marketing. The Facebook page includes a 'Shop Now' button which takes the user to the E Shop website. The page pairs well with the content media marketing on the main site as images of previous projects and new product arrivals can be shared easily.

 ![](docs/readme_images/facebook.png)
### Email Marketing
Visitors to the site can sign up to the newsletter and do not need to have an account to do so. A signup box is included in the footer of the site. This allows the business to share news with customers and potential customers including new products/services and special offers. Mailchimp was used to create this service. 



## Testing
Testing and results can be found [here](/TESTING.md)

## Deployment - Heroku

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

### Create the Heroku App:
- Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) or create an account.
- On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
```
- Run migrations and create a superuser for the new database. 
- Create an if statement in settings.py to run the postgres database when using the app on heroku or sqlite if not

```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',

### Connecting S3 to Django 
- Go back to your IDE and install 2 more requirements:
    - `pip3 install boto3`
    - `pip3 install django-storages` 
- Update your requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` and add storages to your installed apps.
- Create an if statement in settings.py 

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-your-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')

```
- Then add the line 

    - `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'` to tell django where our static files will be coming from in production.


- Create a file called custom storages and import both our settings from django.con as well as the s3boto3 storage class from django storages. 
- Create the following classes:

```
class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

- In settings.py add the following inside the if statement:

```
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

```

- and then add the following at the top of the if statement:
```
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```

- Go to S3, go to your bucket and click 'Create folder'. Name the folder 'media' and click 'Save'.
- Inside the folder, click 'Upload', 'Add files', and then select all the images that you are using for your site.
- Then under 'Permissions' select the option 'Grant public-read access' and click upload.
- Your static files and media files should be automatically linked from django to your S3 bucket.
